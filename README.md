# RVignetteChanges

## Background

With the release of `R 3.0.0`, package authors have the opportunity to write vignettes using alternative engines than the default `Sweave`. For example, it is now possible to generate `html` vignettes using `knitr`. 

## Purpose


We would like to examine **CRAN** and **Bioconductor** `R` packages to track:

  * if there is a change in the frequency of new packages that include vignettes (in the case of CRAN, where vignettes are optional)
  * how many packages switch from Sweave to alternative vignette engines (CRAN and Bioconductor)

This should be evaluated over time, perhaps on a monthly basis, probably for the next year.
